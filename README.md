DeckCheck is a deck construction and planning tool for Magic: The Gathering, a popular and long-running competitive card game. After coming to terms with the horribly bland and generic name of the site, users will find that they can create an account, search for cards, build and save deck compositions for later retrieval and editing. Users who are not logged in cannot create or save decks, but still retain access to some of the site's functionality.

The site fetches card data from Magic: The Gathering's official API, which is detailed here: https://docs.magicthegathering.io
Currently, I am not using any of the available SDK's... because why not get some anger management practice while I'm at it? :P

In-development features include syndicated Magic-related news on the home page, graphs generated to display statistical analysis of a user's deck, responsive page layouts and maybe even a bug-free user experience!

What is Magic: The Gathering?
The long-standing and well-loved game Magic: The Gathering is a competitive card game owned by Wizards of the Coast in which two or more players use decks of cards to defeat their opponent(s). This is done by achieving one of several win conditions, usually while attempting to discern the opponent's strategy and disrupt key cards or combinations. Decks consist of spell, creature and planeswalker cards each having particular abilities, types and a mana costs, typically paid using land cards which act as a sort of currency that refreshes at the beginning of the player's turn. The game begins with players shuffling their decks and drawing seven random cards for their starting hand, so a significant factor in the player's chance of success is in the construction of the deck. Choosing cards with strong synergy and abilities that compliment the strategy of the deck or disrupt that of an opponent is a precarious task due to a wide variety of mechanics and cards coupled with the element of chance. As such, deck building tools are widely used to plan deck compositions, find stronger cards or combinations, gain a better understanding of common deck archetypes and explore different strategies.
